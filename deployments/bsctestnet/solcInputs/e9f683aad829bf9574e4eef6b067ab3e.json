Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number.

If only one oracle is used, this creates a single point of failure and opens a vector\n * for attacking the protocol.\n * \n * The Resilient Oracle uses multiple sources and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect\n * the protocol from oracle attacks. Currently it includes integrations with Chainlink, Pyth, Binance Oracle\n * and TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles. TWAP uses PancakeSwap as the on-chain price source.\n * \n * For every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The oracles are configured per \n * vToken's underlying asset address. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot \n * oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source. \n * \n * To validate prices returned from two oracles, we use an upper and lower bound ratio that is set for every\n * market. The upper bound ratio represents the deviation between reported price (the price that’s being\n * validated) and the anchor price (the price we are validating against) above which the reported price will\n * be invalidated. The lower bound ratio presents the deviation between reported price and anchor price below\n * which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement\n * should be true:\n\n```\nanchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice\nisValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio\n```\n\n * In most cases, Chainlink is used as the main oracle, TWAP or Pyth oracles are used as the pivot oracle depending\n * on which supports the given market and Binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle. For some markets we may\n * use Pyth or TWAP as the main oracle if the token price is not supported by Chainlink or Binance oracles. \n * \n * For a fetched price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the\n * oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.\n */\ncontract ResilientOracle is PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlledV8, ResilientOracleInterface {\n    /**\n     * @dev Oracle roles:\n     * **main**: The most trustworthy price source\n     * **pivot**: Price oracle used as a loose sanity checker\n     * **fallback**: The backup source when main oracle price is invalidated\n     */\n    enum OracleRole {\n        MAIN,\n        PIVOT,\n        FALLBACK\n    }\n\n    struct TokenConfig {\n        /// @notice asset address\n        address asset;\n        /// @notice `oracles` stores the oracles based on their role in the following order:\n        /// [main, pivot, fallback],\n        /// It can be indexed with the corresponding enum OracleRole value\n        address[3] oracles;\n        /// @notice `enableFlagsForOracles` stores the enabled state\n        /// for each oracle in the same order as `oracles`\n        bool[3] enableFlagsForOracles;\n    }\n\n    uint256 public constant INVALID_PRICE = 0;\n\n    /// @notice Native market address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable nativeMarket;\n\n    /// @notice VAI address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable vai;\n\n    /// @notice Set this as asset address for Native token on each chain.This is the underlying for vBNB (on bsc)\n    /// and can serve as any underlying asset of a market that supports native tokens\n    address public constant NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDR = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;\n\n    /// @notice Bound validator contract address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    BoundValidatorInterface public immutable boundValidator;\n\n    mapping(address => TokenConfig) private tokenConfigs;\n\n    event TokenConfigAdded(\n        address indexed asset,\n        address indexed mainOracle,\n        address indexed pivotOracle,\n        address fallbackOracle\n    );\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is set\n    event OracleSet(address indexed asset, address indexed oracle, uint256 indexed role);\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is enabled or disabled\n    event OracleEnabled(address indexed asset, uint256 indexed role, bool indexed enable);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether an address is null or not\n     */\n    modifier notNullAddress(address someone) {\n        if (someone == address(0)) revert(\"can't be zero address\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether token config exists by checking whether asset is null address\n     * @dev address can't be null, so it's suitable to be used to check the validity of the config\n     * @param asset asset address\n     */\n    modifier checkTokenConfigExistence(address asset) {\n        if (tokenConfigs[asset].asset == address(0)) revert(\"token config must exist\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Constructor for the implementation contract.

If amount sent is satisfied(let's say\n * 80 or even 70) then at last the actual amount received and the amount that was supposed to be received by the contract will\n * be compared, if they differ then the whole tx will revert as user was supposed to use `convertExactTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`\n * function for tokenIn as deflationary token.\n *\n * Example 2:-\n *    tokenInAddress - 0xaaaa.....\n *    tokenOutAddress - 0xbbbb.....\n *    tokenInMaxAmount - maximum amount user is willing to provide(let's say 100)\n *    tokenOutAmount - 70\n * Here user can use `convertForExactTokens` or `convertForExactTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`, if tokenIn is deflationary\n * then `convertForExactTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` should be used(let's suppose `convertForExactTokens` is used),\n * which on the basis of tokenOutAmount provided will calculate tokenInAmount based on the tokens prices and will transfer\n * tokens from the user to the contract, now the actual amount received(as tokenInAddress can be deflationary token) will be\n * compared with tokenInMaxAmount if it is greater, tx will revert. If In amount is satisfied(let's say 90 or even 100) then\n * new tokenOutAmount will be calculated, and tokenOutAddress tokens will be transferred to the user, but at last the\n * old tokenOutAmount and new tokenOutAmount will be compared and if they differ whole tx will revert, because user was\n * supposed to use `convertForExactTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` function for tokenIn as deflationary token.\n * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * This contract also supports private conversion between the converters:\n * Private conversions:\n * Private conversions is designed in order to convert the maximum amount of tokens received from PSR(to any converter) between\n * existing converters to save incentive and lower the dependency of users for conversion. So Private Conversion will be executed\n * by converters on it's own whenever funds are received from PSR. No incentive will be offered during private conversion.\n *\n * It will execute on updateAssetsState() function call in Converter Contracts. After this function call, converter will first\n * check for the amount received. If base asset is received then it will be directly sent to the destination address and no private\n * conversion will happen otherwise converter will interact with ConverterNetwork contract to find other valid converters who are providing the conversion for:\n *\n * tokenAddressIn: As asset received by that converter on updateAssetsState() function call.\n * tokenAddressOut: As base asset of that converter.\n *\n * ConverterNetwork:\n * This contract will contain all the converters, and will provide valid converters which can perform the execution according to tokenAddressIn\n * and tokenAddressOut provided.\n *\n * findTokenConverters():\n * It will return an array of converter addresses along with their corresponding balances, sorted in descending order based on the converter's balances\n * relative to tokenAddressOut. This function filter the converter addresses on the basis of the conversionAccess(for users).\n *\n * findTokenConvertersForConverters():\n * It will return an array of converter addresses along with their corresponding balances, sorted in descending order based on the converter's balances\n * relative to tokenAddressOut.
